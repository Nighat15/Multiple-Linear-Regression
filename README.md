I run a multiple linear regression model on the track_data of ads. I have run the model separately for 2 dependent features (Targets) that are complete and click.
complete = Count of ads which are heard completely
click = Count of ads clicked by the user

Independent Variables(Inputs) are impression and district, here district is categorical data.
